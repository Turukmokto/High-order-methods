# High-order-methods

1. Implement the gauss newton and powell dog leg methods to solve the nonlinear regression. Compare the effectiveness with the methods implemented in the previous current works.

2. Implement the bfgs method and investigate its convergence while minimizing the personal functions. Compare with other implemented methods.

3. Implement and explore the l-bfgs method.
